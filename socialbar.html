    dddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddSo, how do I even download torrent files? Do I need any software?üíæ‚è¨
    Welcome to TorrentSites: your ultimate authority on all things related to Peer 2 Peer file sharing and torrenting! This is the only site you will ever need when it comes to finding the best torrent sites, as well as any and all software necessary to start downloading your favorite public domain & free indie & crowdfunded movies, shows, programs, books, music, video games, anime, and documentaries. But you will not only find a comprehensive list of sources for downloading torrents on TorrentSites, I have gone through the trouble of providing you with thoughtful and helpful (I hope) reviews for each one as well. Never again will you have to waste countless hours of trial and error to find the best torrent sites on the web ‚Ä¶ simply read through my reviews and figure out if a site or a program is right for you without rolling the dice yourself.
    
    Speaking of software ‚Äî to answer your question ‚Äî yes, you will need what is called a torrent client program before you can begin downloading files. This is likely the very first step you will need to take before you can begin to take advantage of all of the free indie & crowdfunded movies, TV shows, games, and music that any solid torrent site has to offer. Although some of the most popular torrent clients have recently begun to streamline the process, allowing you to download and stream files directly from their sites (no software necessary), if you want to truly make the most of your torrenting experience, a client that manages your downloads is still highly recommended. Always make sure that anything you download is also 100 % legal in your country of origin.
    
    In addition to a client program, such as Bit Torrent, uTorrent, or my favorite qBittorrent, I always advise newcomers to the world of torrenting to find themselves a good Virtual Private Network (VPN) to protect themselves from hackers.
    
    Why did you create this list of torrent sites in the first place‚ùìü§î
    I created TorrentSites because, well, I am passionate about torrenting. That might sound silly to you, to hear that someone could be passionate about downloading public domain & free indie movies, TV shows, and music from the internet ‚Ä¶ but it is less about the act of downloading the torrents themselves, and more about what that act signifies.
    
    Either way, though, I created TorrentSites because I think that it is important for people to become more torrent literate. I believe that everyone can benefit from more Peer 2 Peer file sharing.
    
    What kind of torrents can I find here?üëçüì°
    As you can see upon browsing TorrentSites for a little while, you will be able to find just about every kind of torrent site that there is ‚Ä¶ except for those that specialize in adult films (for a comprehensive list of pornographic torrent sites, head on over to theporndude.com ‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt worry, your secret is safe with me). TorrentSites has a separate list dedicated to each type of torrent site, as many of them tend to specialize in certain types of content.
    
    Sure, there are the sort of catch-all websites, which have a sprawling selection of all kinds of torrents, but there are also those that focus more on certain niches. On TorrentSites, you will be able to find the perfect site for what you are looking for, be it for public domain & free indie movies download, TV shows, eBooks, software, music, documentaries, anime, or video games. No matter the medium, if it exists (and enough people know about it), there is a good chance that the best torrent sites have it available for download.
    
    Plus, TorrentSites is here to help you find all of the necessary (and useful) software you will need to torrent files as efficiently and safely as possible. In addition to being able to find the best site for torrenting whatever file you happen to be looking for, TorrentSites also has tons of torrent download client programs, VPNs for torrenting, download managers, and torrent news sites. To put it simply, if it relates to torrenting in any way, shape, or form, you‚Äôll be able to find it here!
    
    Some torrent sites seem to be missing ‚Ä¶ why is that? üôÜ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
    I have chosen not to undertake the daunting endeavor of trying to list every single torrent site in existence. This is because, to be blunt, not all torrent sites are created equally. Instead of linking to the many sub-par, inactive, or potentially dangerous torrent sites out there, I have decided to only list and review the best torrent sites that allow you to download torrents easily and with no worries.
    
    In order to earn a TorrentSites review, in other words, a site has to be of a certain level of quality to begin with. What would be the point in listing and reviewing bad websites, right? If a particular site is not listed, you can just assume it did not make the cut. Here, you‚Äôll find only the best torrent sites.
    
    Unfortunately, not every torrent resource on the web is out to help you. Chances are, at some point or another, you have heard somebody say that they stay away from torrenting because they are worried about the safety of their computers. It is true ‚Ä¶ some sites simply have a bad reputation.
    
    Maybe they have a high density of hackers who embed their files with viruses, malware, trojans, etc. Maybe they do not have an active community of users who go out of their way to help one another out with comments and in-depth instructions for more complicated torrent files. Maybe they do not use a system of verified torrents. Maybe their site is just not easy to use. It could be poorly designed, riddled with ads, asking for your credit card information.
    
    As is the case with every corner of the internet, scammers and malicious entities lurk in the shadows of tst is to weed out the bad actors and the sites that let such activity flourish. I take this list very seriously and, so, there are plenty of sites that I have gone out of my way to intentionally leave out. Trust me, it‚Äôs for the best.

    Another reason for a site potentially not being included on these lists is the fact that, well, I am only human! There are new torrenting sites being published nearly every day.
    
    If you know of an awesome torrent site that I may have missed, feel free to shoot me an email and I‚Äôll be more than happy to check it out and add it to the list if it makes the cut!
    
    What are torrents anyway?üé•‚ùì
    Ah, I thought you‚Äôd never ask! The technical answer to this question is that torrents are files that contain information related to additional files and folders to be distributed to you upon download. To illustrate, when you download an indie movie torrent file, what you are actually downloading is all of the relevant data necessary in order to access that movie when the download is completed.
    
    Therefore, you are never actually downloading that public domain or free indie movie, in this case, in full. Instead, you are downloading pieces or ‚Äúbits‚Äù of that free indie movie, from multiple sources, piece by piece. If the public domain or free indie movies or TV shows in question were completed puzzles, in other words, you would be receiving them one piece at a time, from numerous other users around the world. When the torrent is finished downloading, then, you‚Äôll have the completed puzzle, all of its pieces already snapped perfectly into place, allowing you to access it as a completed file.
    
    This works through a matrix of what are called ‚Äúseeders‚Äù and ‚Äúleechers.‚Äù When you click on magnet links of torrent files, you should notice that torrent files come with an up-to-date account of how many seeders and leechers are actively sharing the file. The number of seeders indicates how many people are sharing the files, and the number of leechers tells you how many people are currently trying to download it.
    
    The best torrents, in terms of speedy downloading, are those that have more seeders than leechers. Once your torrent is finished downloading, most torrent clients automatically start seeding the data, making it more accessible for others. Hence the title of ‚Äúpeer 2 peer‚Äù file sharing.
    
    I cannot stress enough how important it is for people to seed their torrents. Sharing, after all, is caring ‚Äî especially when it comes to creating faster, better torrent sites. It may be tempting to simply delete the seeding file once your download is complete. All that I ask of you in exchange for this enormous list of the best sites for torrenting on the web is that you seed your files ‚Ä¶ at least for a little while. It takes a village to download a torrent. So, the community aspect of peer 2 peer file sharing is crucial for everyone involved!
